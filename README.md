​        We won Championship in Myanmar Roboleague 2019, and managed to get into First Global Challenge 2019.
​        188 countries participated in the match and we won Judges First Award.

​        We named our robot **Flyin Dutchman** because of its task to do adventures in the seas and recycle.
​        It took 3 months for us to implement the system.
​        The engineering notebook could be accessed in the docs folder.

    For shooting micro-pollutants, the pollutants will be placed between the two wheels which are rotating very high speed. When the pollutants get into those wheels, they will be fired to the desired location. 
    The two wheels which act as shooters will be controlled by a single motor and connected through gears. They will be rotating with same speed so that the pollutants won’t change direction but move straight while shooting. 
    The total gear ratio for speed will be 25/6 x  3/1 = 25/2  or 25:2 (12.5) which means that the speed will be 12.5 faster than the original speed generated by the motor. Increasing the speed makes the micro-pollutants push with greater kinetic energy.

​        The prototype arena that we made ourselves with the limited materials for the test drive of our robot.
​        The task is to shoot the small balls into the topmost basket which result in 20 points, and to put the big balls into the middle basket, each of them having 10 points
​        Finally, the robot has to save itself from water by pulling up the bar, resulting in 30 points.
​        Three countries become allies and compete with the opponent alliance of 3 countries every game.

​        **Robot Flywheel Mechanism**. The main goal is to grab the balls scattered throughout the floor and shoot them to the top basket.
​        **PIDF** control system is used to control the velocity of flywheel and the ball.
​        Mathematics and physics are heavily applied to calculate the required input needed.

​        Our best game in FGC2019.
​        Even though we did not win any top spots, we managed to get **Judges First Award** for implementation, robot design, mathematics concepts, and robot engineering book.



​        Fun bottle cap challenge with the flywheel.
