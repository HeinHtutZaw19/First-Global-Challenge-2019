​We named our robot **Flyin Dutchman**. It took 3 months for us to implement the system. We used REV robotics kit with main language being JAVA. Our main task is to save as many people(balls) as possible before the flood, and when the timer is up we would have to dock ourselves onto the bar. Saving small balls onto the toppest bin is worth 20 points, big balls into middle basket is worth 10 points, and safely docking is worth 30 points. ​Three countries become allies and compete with the opponent alliance of 3 countries every game. 

## MECHANICAL DESIGN
### FLYWHEEL MECHANISM

For shooting micro-pollutants, the pollutants will be placed between the two wheels which are rotating very high speed. When the pollutants get into those wheels, they will be fired to the desired location. 
The two wheels which act as shooters will be controlled by a single motor and connected through gears. They will be rotating with same speed so that the pollutants won’t change direction but move straight while shooting. 
The total gear ratio for speed will be 25/6 x  3/1 = 25/2  or 25:2 (12.5) which means that the speed will be 12.5 faster than the original speed generated by the motor. Increasing the speed makes the micro-pollutants push with greater kinetic energy.

### BIG BALL LIFTING MECHANISM

​**Robot Flywheel Mechanism**. The main goal is to grab the balls scattered throughout the floor and shoot them to the top basket.
​**PIDF** control system is used to control the velocity of flywheel and the ball.
​Mathematics and physics are heavily applied to calculate the required input needed.

​Our best game in FGC2019.
​Even though we did not win any top spots, we managed to get **Judges First Award** for implementation, robot design, mathematics concepts, and robot engineering book.



​        Fun bottle cap challenge with the flywheel.
